## Background

Community is my full-stack capstone project for [Nashville Software School](http://www.nashvillesoftwareschool).

Community is a platform to connect volunteers with local nonprofit organizations. It serves nonprofit organizations by creating a platform where volunteers can sign up for events and event organizers can send all event-related communications through the application. Users can create accounts, search for events in their area, and attend events.

This project is scheduled to be completed by Nashville Software School's Demo Day on January 10, 2017.
